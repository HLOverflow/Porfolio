dijkstra algorithm    
- find shortest path given a graph

merge sort (not so good version - require auxiliary array)
- sort in ascending order by recursively divide the list until size of 1, then merge them back with comparisons.

sorting (better version)
- file contains bubblesort, selectionsort, insertionsort, mergesort(no auxiliary array), quicksort

backtrack             
- use backtracking to find solutions using depth first search.
