pwnWindows_x86.sh
    This is a script to be used in Kali linux where the tools are already preinstalled. 
    This script will generate a reverse shell evil.exe, 
    host it on local webserver and start meterpreter listener.
    The target somehow download this evil.exe, run it and is then connected back to the attacker.
    This is just for education purpose, hence the obvious file naming without much trickery.
